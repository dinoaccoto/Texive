      <h1>Texive - FAQ</h1>
      
    </header>

      <h2>What kind of information is collected?</h2>
      <p>No information whatsoever. Also what you type and the files you upload or save remain between you and your terminal. Relax and enjoy a friendly site that doesn't even want to bother you by offering cookies.</p>

      <h2>Does Texive make use of cookies?</h2>
      <p>No cookies here. Have some real ones with a good coffee instead.</p>

      <h2>Is Texive open source?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Since there is no activity running on the server side, the complete code is visible through the browser. </p>

      <h2>Is Texive free?</h2>
      <p>Texive is free for non-commercial use. Of course, it is offered as is. You are responsible for its use, including inadvertent loss of text which you typed but that you did not save in time before it disappeared from your terminal.</p>

      <h2>May I download and modify Texive?</h2>
      <p>Yes, as long as you explicitly refer to the original website and you keep it free. </p>

      <h2>Can I find Texive on Github?</h2>
      <p>No. The reason is that the philosophy of Texive is to keep eveyrthing simple. The editor and the parser are indeed implemented in a single HTML+JavaScript page, which is less than 1000 lines, comments included. Just download it and have fun.</p>

      <h2>How can I contribute?</h2>
      <p>First of all, you can share your experience by letting us know if you spotted bugs, or if you have improvements to suggest. Just send an email  <img src="emadd.jpg" width="200"></p>
